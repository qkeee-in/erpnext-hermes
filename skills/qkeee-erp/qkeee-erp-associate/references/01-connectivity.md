# Connectivity: REST/Frappe, env resolution, discover.py

The mechanics every domain shares — auth, the environment/tag model, env
var resolution, and metadata discovery. Domain judgment (what counts as a
valid GST return, whether an offer letter needs a second approval) does
NOT belong here — that lives in each `references/domains/<slug>.md` file.
If `qkeee-erp-associate` ever needs to target a different ERP backend,
this file and `scripts/core/client.py` are what change; the domain files
and `00-conventions.md` don't (they're written to be ERP-agnostic in
substance, ERPNext specifics called out as pointers).

## Auth

ERPNext (Frappe framework) REST API, token auth:

```
Authorization: token <api_key>:<api_secret>
```

Keys are generated per ERPNext user via **User → API Access → Generate
Keys** in the ERPNext UI, or via `scripts/init_bot.py`/
`ensure_bot_user.py`'s provisioning flow (see
`references/domains/system-admin.md`). **Must be a dedicated bot/
integration user, never a human's personal login** — see
`00-conventions.md`'s GRC baseline for why.

## Environment / tag model

Config is tagged, not a fixed dev/test/qa/prod enum. At install time the
frontmatter declares exactly one literal tag, `DEFAULT`
(`QKEEE_ERP_DEFAULT_BASE_URL`/`_API_KEY`/`_API_SECRET`). A user who wants a
different first tag name, or a second/third environment later, sets that
tag's three vars themselves at runtime — this skill walks them through
naming and var-setting, it doesn't declare the vars for them:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_BASE_URL` | e.g. `https://org.erpnext.com` |
| `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_API_KEY` | API key for that site/user |
| `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_API_SECRET` | API secret for that site/user |
| `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_ALLOW_INSECURE` | OPTIONAL. Set `1` to allow a non-`https://` base URL (local/dev only — `get_env_config()` refuses plaintext by default since credentials go in the clear otherwise) |
| `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_REQUESTED_BY` | OPTIONAL, no default. Per-tag requester identity fallback — never used on a PROD-tagged environment, see below |
| `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_ENV_CLASS` | OPTIONAL. `prod`/`production` forces PROD rules regardless of the tag's name; `nonprod`/`dev`/`test`/`qa`/`staging`/`uat` forces non-PROD even if the name matches `/prod/i`. Unset falls back to the name-based rule below. Set this explicitly rather than relying on naming discipline when the tag name won't reliably contain "prod" |

There is no `_DEBUG` var — read audit logging is unconditional (every
read logs to `Qkeee Bot Audit Log`, no per-tag opt-in), so there is no
debug flag to resolve. See `00-conventions.md`'s GRC baseline.

`<TAG>` is uppercased/sanitized from whatever the user names it (`qa`,
`client-a-prod`, etc). Adding a second/third environment is a runtime
action: walk the user through naming a new tag and appending its three
vars to `qkeee-erp.env` (below), then offer to switch
`qkeee_erp.active_env`. `qkeee_erp.active_env` and `qkeee_erp.mode` stay
global `metadata.hermes.config` values — switching environments should
never silently also change write access, so `mode` requires its own
explicit confirmation independent of which tag is active.

**PROD tags get a stricter requester rule.** A tag counts as PRODUCTION if
`QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_ENV_CLASS` explicitly says so, or — absent that override —
its name matches `/prod/i` anywhere (`PROD_ERP`, `client-a-prod`,
`Production` all match). Set `ENV_CLASS` explicitly for a production tag
whose name won't reliably contain "prod"; don't rely on naming discipline
alone for something this consequential. On a PROD tag, `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_REQUESTED_BY`'s
env-var default is refused even if configured — a PROD call must pass an
explicit, freshly-validated `--requested-by` every time. Before any read
or write on a PROD tag, resolve the inbound channel identity (the user's
own work email/chat identity) as a real ERPNext user id and pass it
explicitly; never invent or guess a requester to work around this.

## Env resolution — why `qkeee-erp.env`, not native frontmatter passthrough

**This is a deliberate exception, documented here so it doesn't read as an
oversight on review.** Hermes' own
`required_environment_variables`/`required_credential_files` frontmatter
auto-registers passthrough into `execute_code`/`terminal` sandboxes — but
those sandboxes strip *all* env vars by default, and only names a skill
*statically* declares in frontmatter survive the strip. That mechanism
only covers the single `DEFAULT`-tag case: a user-chosen tag name (`qa`,
`client-a-prod`, a second/third environment added at runtime) can never be
declared ahead of time in static frontmatter, so `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_*` for
any tag other than the one named at install time would silently never
reach the sandbox — even when correctly set in the profile's real `.env`.
This is not a hypothetical: it caused a real incident (a `DEMO_ERP`-tagged
run hit `Missing environment variable(s)`, and the only way it recovered
in the moment was by reading the `.env` file's raw contents into the
model's own context to reconstruct the values — leaking the API key/
secret through the LLM prompt).

`qkeee-erp.env` fixes this structurally: `core/client.py`'s
`_qkeee_env_file_path()` resolves `$HERMES_HOME/qkeee-erp.env` and reads
it **directly**, bypassing the sandbox's env stripping and Hermes'
`env_passthrough` allowlist entirely — the script never needs the values
to have survived sandbox stripping in the first place, because it isn't
reading `os.environ` for them (it only falls back to `os.environ` if the
file is absent, for back-compat with a manually-exported shell). One file
holds every tag's vars at once, and `HERMES_HOME` itself is
unconditionally forwarded into every sandbox child regardless of skill
declarations, so it's a reliable anchor even when the tag-specific vars
themselves aren't.

**Where a script only ever needs the `DEFAULT` tag** (e.g.
`init_bot.py`'s elevated key, which is admin-invoked and one-time, not a
per-conversation tag switch), prefer the native frontmatter declaration
instead of this custom `.env` read — the exception above exists
specifically for the multi-tag case, not as a blanket preference over the
native mechanism. Use the `${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}` template token for any
path a script needs to itself, rather than a hardcoded relative path.

**Never read `qkeee-erp.env`'s contents into your own context to
"confirm" it, and never compose a command that embeds a raw secret
value.** If a value needs confirming, ask the user to check the file
themselves, out-of-band. This file is deliberately **not** the profile's
main `.env` — keeps credentials physically separate from any LLM-provider
secret that might live there.

## Discovering a doctype's live shape — `discover.py`

Never propose a field/doctype shape from general ERPNext knowledge alone
(Non-negotiable 4 in `00-conventions.md`). Resolve it against the live
instance first:

- `discover.py resolve "<DocType>"` — module + owning app +
  submittable/custom flags. Run before assuming any doctype is uncovered
  custom territory.
- `discover.py meta "<DocType>"` — full live field list, mandatory flags,
  Link targets. Authoritative over any doc or memory of a prior instance.
  **Known prerequisite:** both calls hit `GET /api/resource/DocType/<name>`,
  which requires System Manager–level read access — a correctly
  least-privileged steady-state bot account can 403 here. Don't present
  that as a connectivity bug; tell the user their bot account needs read
  access to `DocType`, or ask them to paste the relevant field list from
  the Customize Form screen instead.
- `discover.py modules` — installed-app inventory via a plain `Module Def`
  list read (confirmed working broadly). `discover.py apps` mirrors the
  Help → About dialog and includes version numbers `modules` can't derive,
  but its whitelisted RPC method has been observed blocked
  (`PermissionError: not whitelisted`) on at least one real instance —
  treat it as opportunistic, fall back to `modules` silently, and only ask
  the user to paste Help → About if exact versions matter and both fail.
  See `02-environment-assessment.md` for the full cataloging procedure
  this feeds.

## Query cost: list endpoint vs. single-resource GET

`core.client.query_resource()` (the list endpoint, with `filters`/
`fields`) silently drops Table-type (child-table) fields even when named
in `fields` — confirmed live, not a bug to work around, a structural
Frappe behavior. `core.client.get_resource()` (single-resource GET)
ignores `fields` entirely and always returns the full doc, including
child tables — the only path that returns them, needed whenever a review
step checks child-table Link validity (line items, roles, permission
rows). Use `query_resource()` with explicit `fields` whenever child-table
data isn't needed — routinely 20-25x cheaper (a few hundred bytes vs.
several thousand, confirmed live on more than one doctype). `get_resource()`
noise-strips audit/system metadata and presentation-only HTML fields by
default (`strip_noise=True`) — never strips Link fields or child tables.

Always check `has_more` on a `query_resource()` response before treating a
result set as complete — a truncated pull is the easiest way to produce a
report or review that looks right but doesn't reconcile.

## Built-in reports vs. hand-aggregated queries

Prefer `core.client.run_query_report()` (wraps
`frappe.desk.query_report.run`) over hand-aggregating raw rows whenever a
built-in ERPNext report already covers the need — it already implements
dimension filters, Finance Book gates, and currency conversion correctly;
a hand-rolled aggregation risks silently missing one of those. `filters`
is a plain dict of report-specific values; field names vary per report —
confirm the exact filter keys a given report expects by opening it in the
ERPNext UI once, since this generic endpoint doesn't self-document
per-report filter schemas.

## Working scratch (rare)

Any file this skill's tooling needs to write that isn't the final
deliverable — a staged artifact genuinely too large to hold in the
conversation — goes under `<profile>/workspace/qkeee-erp/<env-tag>/`,
plain file I/O, never `/tmp`. **Not `terminal.cwd`:** the local CLI
backend (this skill's primary usage path) deliberately ignores that
config key and always uses the launch directory — only gateway- and
cron-driven sessions bridge it into a fixed path. `<profile>/workspace/`
is the one directory
that's stable regardless of which backend or invocation mode is running,
provisioned at profile creation alongside `memories/`, `skills/`, etc. —
see `00-conventions.md`'s naming table. Most tasks need none of this:
Hermes' own session transcript already retains the working conversation,
so reach for scratch only when something is genuinely too bulky to keep
in context. Clean scratch files up once the task no longer needs them —
disposable, never assumed present next session.

**Task specs are the deliberate exception.** They target the working
directory directly instead of `<profile>/workspace/` — the whole point is
for the user to see the file sitting alongside their own project, not
tucked inside the Hermes profile. "Ignores the `terminal.cwd` config key"
above doesn't mean "writes nowhere near the working directory" — the
local CLI backend still writes relative to the real launch directory it
started from, and a spec uses exactly that. See
`references/03-spec-driven-execution.md`.

## Harness capability discovery

If the host harness exposes a way to enumerate installed tools/skills and
one already does authenticated HTTP well, prefer it over shelling out to
`core/client.py`. `core.client.discover_harness_http_tool()` is a stub
that reports "nothing pre-discovered" — this skill's own bundled
connector is always the fallback, never assume discovery itself is
supported; degrade gracefully if it isn't.

## CLI usage

`core/client.py` and each `domains/<slug>.py` module are runnable
directly for manual/ad hoc use — `python core/client.py --tag <tag>
health`, `python core/client.py --tag <tag> --mode read-write mutate
<DocType> create --domain <slug> --payload '{...}' --requested-by
<id>`. See `core/client.py`'s own `_cli()` for the full subcommand list
(`health`, `list-envs`, `query`, `get`, `report`, `roles`, `mutate`,
`gated-mutate`). Every invocation is relative to this
skill's own `scripts/` directory under the active Hermes profile root —
`cd` there first, or prefix every command with the full path; don't guess
a shorter path.
