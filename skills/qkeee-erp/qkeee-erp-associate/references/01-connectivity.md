# Connectivity: REST/Frappe, env resolution, discover.py

The mechanics every domain shares — auth, the environment/tag model, env
var resolution, and metadata discovery. Domain judgment (what counts as a
valid GST return, whether an offer letter needs a second approval) does
NOT belong here — that lives in each `references/domains/<slug>.md` file.
If `qkeee-erp-associate` ever needs to target a different ERP backend,
this file and `scripts/core/client.py` are what change; the domain files
and `00-conventions.md` don't (they're written to be ERP-agnostic in
substance, ERPNext specifics called out as pointers).

## Auth

ERPNext (Frappe framework) REST API, token auth:

```
Authorization: token <api_key>:<api_secret>
```

Keys are generated per ERPNext user via **User → API Access → Generate
Keys** in the ERPNext UI, or via `scripts/init_bot.py`/
`ensure_bot_user.py`'s provisioning flow (see
`references/domains/system-admin.md`). **Must be a dedicated bot/
integration user, never a human's personal login** — see
`00-conventions.md`'s GRC baseline for why.

## Environment / tag model

Config is tagged, not a fixed dev/test/qa/prod enum. At install time the
frontmatter declares exactly one literal tag, `DEFAULT`
(`QKEEE_ERP_DEFAULT_BASE_URL`/`_API_KEY`/`_API_SECRET`). A user who wants a
different first tag name, or a second/third environment later, sets that
tag's three vars themselves at runtime — this skill walks them through
naming and var-setting, it doesn't declare the vars for them:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_BASE_URL` | e.g. `https://org.erpnext.com` |
| `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_API_KEY` | API key for that site/user |
| `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_API_SECRET` | API secret for that site/user |
| `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_ALLOW_INSECURE` | OPTIONAL. Set `1` to allow a non-`https://` base URL (local/dev only — `get_env_config()` refuses plaintext by default since credentials go in the clear otherwise) |

There is no `_DEBUG` var — read audit logging is unconditional (every
read logs to `Qkeee Bot Audit Log`, no per-tag opt-in), so there is no
debug flag to resolve. See `00-conventions.md`'s GRC baseline.

There is also no `_REQUESTED_BY` or `_ENV_CLASS` var (removed) — see
below.

`<TAG>` is uppercased/sanitized from whatever the user names it (`qa`,
`client-a-prod`, etc). Adding a second/third environment is a runtime
action: walk the user through naming a new tag and appending its three
vars to `qkeee-erp.env` (below), then offer to switch
`qkeee_erp.active_env`. `qkeee_erp.active_env` and `qkeee_erp.mode` stay
global `metadata.hermes.config` values — switching environments should
never silently also change write access, so `mode` requires its own
explicit confirmation independent of which tag is active.

**Requester identity: one rule, every tag, no config.** There used to be a
PROD-only strict rule and a `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_REQUESTED_BY`/`_ENV_CLASS`
pair backing it; both are gone. `requested_by` now has exactly one source
on every tag, PROD or not: the live inbound channel identity of whoever
sent the message this call is answering — the Google Chat/Teams/Slack
sender's own work email, the email channel's From address, whatever the
platform actually hands over for "who sent this." Resolve it fresh on
every single call (never cache or reuse a value from an earlier call in
the same conversation), confirm it as a real ERPNext `User` (this is
already enforced in code — `_validate_prod_requester()` in
`core/client.py` refuses a call outright without a validated requester,
on every tag), and pass it explicitly via `--requested-by` /
`requested_by=`. Never invent, guess, or fall back to any standing
default to get past this — there is no default left to fall back to.

## Env resolution — why `qkeee-erp.env`, not native frontmatter passthrough

**This is a deliberate exception, documented here so it doesn't read as an
oversight on review.** Hermes' own
`required_environment_variables`/`required_credential_files` frontmatter
auto-registers passthrough into `execute_code`/`terminal` sandboxes — but
those sandboxes strip *all* env vars by default, and only names a skill
*statically* declares in frontmatter survive the strip. That mechanism
only covers the single `DEFAULT`-tag case: a user-chosen tag name (`qa`,
`client-a-prod`, a second/third environment added at runtime) can never be
declared ahead of time in static frontmatter, so `QKEEE_ERP_<TAG>_*` for
any tag other than the one named at install time would silently never
reach the sandbox — even when correctly set in the profile's real `.env`.
This is not a hypothetical: it caused a real incident (a `DEMO_ERP`-tagged
run hit `Missing environment variable(s)`, and the only way it recovered
in the moment was by reading the `.env` file's raw contents into the
model's own context to reconstruct the values — leaking the API key/
secret through the LLM prompt).

`qkeee-erp.env` fixes this structurally: `core/client.py`'s
`_qkeee_env_file_path()` resolves `$HERMES_HOME/qkeee-erp.env` and reads
it **directly**, bypassing the sandbox's env stripping and Hermes'
`env_passthrough` allowlist entirely — the script never needs the values
to have survived sandbox stripping in the first place, because it isn't
reading `os.environ` for them (it only falls back to `os.environ` if the
file is absent, for back-compat with a manually-exported shell). One file
holds every tag's vars at once, and `HERMES_HOME` itself is
unconditionally forwarded into every sandbox child regardless of skill
declarations, so it's a reliable anchor even when the tag-specific vars
themselves aren't.

**Where a script only ever needs the `DEFAULT` tag** (e.g.
`init_bot.py`'s elevated key, which is admin-invoked and one-time, not a
per-conversation tag switch), prefer the native frontmatter declaration
instead of this custom `.env` read — the exception above exists
specifically for the multi-tag case, not as a blanket preference over the
native mechanism. Use the `${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}` template token for any
path a script needs to itself, rather than a hardcoded relative path.

**Never read `qkeee-erp.env`'s contents into your own context to
"confirm" it, and never compose a command that embeds a raw secret
value.** If a value needs confirming, ask the user to check the file
themselves, out-of-band. This file is deliberately **not** the profile's
main `.env` — keeps credentials physically separate from any LLM-provider
secret that might live there.

## Discovering a doctype's live shape — `discover.py`

Never propose a field/doctype shape from general ERPNext knowledge alone
(Non-negotiable 4 in `00-conventions.md`). Resolve it against the live
instance first:

- `discover.py resolve "<DocType>"` — module + owning app +
  submittable/custom flags. Run before assuming any doctype is uncovered
  custom territory.
- `discover.py meta "<DocType>"` — full live field list, mandatory flags,
  Link targets. Authoritative over any doc or memory of a prior instance.
  **Known prerequisite:** both calls hit `GET /api/resource/DocType/<name>`,
  which requires System Manager–level read access — a correctly
  least-privileged steady-state bot account can 403 here. Don't present
  that as a connectivity bug; tell the user their bot account needs read
  access to `DocType`, or ask them to paste the relevant field list from
  the Customize Form screen instead.
- `discover.py modules` — installed-app inventory via a plain `Module Def`
  list read (confirmed working broadly). `discover.py apps` mirrors the
  Help → About dialog and includes version numbers `modules` can't derive,
  but its whitelisted RPC method has been observed blocked
  (`PermissionError: not whitelisted`) on at least one real instance —
  treat it as opportunistic, fall back to `modules` silently, and only ask
  the user to paste Help → About if exact versions matter and both fail.
  See `02-environment-assessment.md` for the full cataloging procedure
  this feeds.

## Query cost: list endpoint vs. single-resource GET

`core.client.query_resource()` (the list endpoint, with `filters`/
`fields`) silently drops Table-type (child-table) fields even when named
in `fields` — confirmed live, not a bug to work around, a structural
Frappe behavior. `core.client.get_resource()` (single-resource GET)
ignores `fields` entirely and always returns the full doc, including
child tables — the only path that returns them, needed whenever a review
step checks child-table Link validity (line items, roles, permission
rows). Use `query_resource()` with explicit `fields` whenever child-table
data isn't needed — routinely 20-25x cheaper (a few hundred bytes vs.
several thousand, confirmed live on more than one doctype). `get_resource()`
noise-strips audit/system metadata and presentation-only HTML fields by
default (`strip_noise=True`) — never strips Link fields or child tables.

Always check `has_more` on a `query_resource()` response before treating a
result set as complete — a truncated pull is the easiest way to produce a
report or review that looks right but doesn't reconcile.

## Built-in reports vs. hand-aggregated queries

Prefer `core.client.run_query_report()` (wraps
`frappe.desk.query_report.run`) over hand-aggregating raw rows whenever a
built-in ERPNext report already covers the need — it already implements
dimension filters, Finance Book gates, and currency conversion correctly;
a hand-rolled aggregation risks silently missing one of those. `filters`
is a plain dict of report-specific values; field names vary per report —
confirm the exact filter keys a given report expects by opening it in the
ERPNext UI once, since this generic endpoint doesn't self-document
per-report filter schemas.

## Working scratch (rare)

Any file this skill's tooling needs to write that isn't the final
deliverable — a staged artifact genuinely too large to hold in the
conversation — goes under `<profile>/workspace/qkeee-erp/<env-tag>/`,
plain file I/O, never `/tmp`. **Not `terminal.cwd`:** the local CLI
backend (this skill's primary usage path) deliberately ignores that
config key and always uses the launch directory — only gateway- and
cron-driven sessions bridge it into a fixed path. `<profile>/workspace/`
is the one directory
that's stable regardless of which backend or invocation mode is running,
provisioned at profile creation alongside `memories/`, `skills/`, etc. —
see `00-conventions.md`'s naming table. Most tasks need none of this:
Hermes' own session transcript already retains the working conversation,
so reach for scratch only when something is genuinely too bulky to keep
in context. Clean scratch files up once the task no longer needs them —
disposable, never assumed present next session.

**Task specs are the deliberate exception.** They target the working
directory directly instead of `<profile>/workspace/` — the whole point is
for the user to see the file sitting alongside their own project, not
tucked inside the Hermes profile. "Ignores the `terminal.cwd` config key"
above doesn't mean "writes nowhere near the working directory" — the
local CLI backend still writes relative to the real launch directory it
started from, and a spec uses exactly that. See
`references/03-spec-driven-execution.md`.

## Harness capability discovery

If the host harness exposes a way to enumerate installed tools/skills and
one already does authenticated HTTP well, prefer it over shelling out to
`core/client.py`. `core.client.discover_harness_http_tool()` is a stub
that reports "nothing pre-discovered" — this skill's own bundled
connector is always the fallback, never assume discovery itself is
supported; degrade gracefully if it isn't.

## CLI usage

`core/client.py` and each `domains/<slug>.py` module are runnable
directly for manual/ad hoc use. See `core/client.py`'s own `_cli()` for
the full subcommand list (`health`, `list-envs`, `query`, `get`, `report`,
`roles`, `mutate`, `gated-mutate`).

**`core/client.py`'s own `mutate`/`gated-mutate` subcommands are read-only-safe to explore but not the write entry point — use `execute_write.py` for every actual write.** `mutate --domain <slug>` looks like the domain-scoped write path, but `core/client.py` never imports any `domains/*.py` module itself — run standalone in a fresh process, `--domain procurement` 404s with "domain has no registered ALLOWED_WRITE_DOCTYPES" even though `domains/procurement.py` genuinely declares one (`register_domain_allowlist()` only runs at that module's *own* import time). `scripts/execute_write.py` imports every `domains/*.py` module up front specifically so this isn't a trap, and it's the one write entry point regardless of whether the target doctype belongs to a named domain (`--domain <slug>` → `mutate_resource()`) or not (omit `--domain`, pass `--confirmation-token`/`--issued-at` → `gated_mutate_resource()`). See its own module docstring — this is also where a real bug got fixed: hand-writing a fresh one-off Python script per write is exactly how `session_id`/`channel_metadata`/`latest_prompt` kept getting left blank, and `execute_write.py` WARNs loudly on stderr, before the write fires, if any of those three are missing — don't route around that warning by constructing the underlying `mutate_resource()`/`gated_mutate_resource()` call directly in a hand-written script instead.

**Exact path — don't guess it.** The script lives at
`<profile>/skills/qkeee-erp/qkeee-erp-associate/scripts/core/client.py`
(the `qkeee-erp-associate/` segment is easy to drop — `skills/qkeee-erp/
scripts/...` is a real, previously-observed wrong guess that costs a
wasted round trip). `cd` into `.../qkeee-erp-associate/scripts` first, or
prefix every command with the full path — verify with one `search_files`/
listing at the start of a session if there's any doubt, rather than
guessing and retrying on failure.

**Copy these verbatim, substitute values, don't hand-construct flags
from memory.** A malformed `--filters`/`--fields` argument is a
previously-observed wasted round trip (`usage: client.py [-h] [--tag
TAG]...` argparse error) — these four cover the overwhelming majority of
read-only lookups:

```
# Connectivity + auth check — run first, every session
python core/client.py --tag <tag> health

# List configured environment tags
python core/client.py --tag <tag> list-envs

# Filtered, field-scoped list query — the default shape for "fetch X
# where Y" asks. filters is a JSON list of [field, operator, value]
# triples; fields is a JSON list of field names (see 01-connectivity.md's
# "Query cost" section above for why to always scope fields).
python core/client.py --tag <tag> query <DocType> \
  --filters '[["supplier", "=", "<value>"], ["company", "=", "<value>"], ["docstatus", "=", 0]]' \
  --fields '["name", "supplier", "company", "posting_date", "grand_total", "status"]' \
  --limit 20

# Single-resource GET — full doc including child tables (line items,
# etc.) — use only when child-table data is actually needed, see "Query
# cost" above.
python core/client.py --tag <tag> get <DocType> <name>
```

`docstatus`: `0` = Draft, `1` = Submitted, `2` = Cancelled — use this in
`--filters` for any "draft"/"submitted"/"cancelled" phrasing in the
request rather than a status-name guess.

For a write, see the matching `domains/<slug>.md` file for the exact
payload shape and required fields — don't freehand a payload from this
connectivity file alone. Fire the write itself through `execute_write.py`
(see above), never a hand-written script that reconstructs
`mutate_resource()`/`gated_mutate_resource()` inline:

```
# Domain-scoped write — Supplier belongs to procurement's
# ALLOWED_WRITE_DOCTYPES. Supplier 'create' additionally requires --kyc
# (creates the linked Address/Contact in the same call — see
# domains/procurement.md's "Supplier KYC write order") or, only when the
# user explicitly confirmed proceeding without it, --kyc-waiver-confirmed.
python execute_write.py --tag <tag> --mode read-write \
  --requested-by <requester-email> --doctype Supplier --action create \
  --domain procurement \
  --payload '{"supplier_name": "<value>", "supplier_type": "Company", ...}' \
  --kyc '{"address": {"address_line1": "<value>", "<tax-id field confirmed via discover.py meta \"Address\">": "<value>", ...}}' \
  --session-id <this-logical-session-id> \
  --channel-metadata '{"space": "<platform-space-id>", "thread": "<platform-thread-id>"}' \
  --prompt-summary "<one-line paraphrase>" \
  --latest-prompt "<the user's literal most-recent message>"

# Domain-less write — Item belongs to no domain's allowlist yet. For an
# item sourced from a purchase document (PO, purchase invoice, GRN), add
# --purchase-sourced-item: defaults is_purchase_item=1/is_sales_item=0
# (nothing in a purchase document supports "the org resells this") and
# refuses a bare standard_rate key (that auto-creates a Standard SELLING
# Item Price from what was actually a purchase cost; see
# item_write_helpers.py for the buying-side alternative). Omit --domain,
# supply the advisory-draft token, AND the user's own literal reply
# containing confirm_token.py's printed
# confirmation_code (show them the code in the rendered draft first —
# never construct this string yourself, see confirmation_code()'s
# docstring for why that defeats the point).
python execute_write.py --tag <tag> --mode read-write \
  --requested-by <requester-email> --doctype Item --action create \
  --payload '{"item_code": "<value>", ...}' \
  --confirmation-token <from confirm_token.py> --issued-at <same> \
  --user-confirmation-text "<the user's actual reply, e.g. 'yes 284D51'>" \
  --session-id <this-logical-session-id> \
  --channel-metadata '{"space": "<platform-space-id>", "thread": "<platform-thread-id>"}' \
  --prompt-summary "<one-line paraphrase>" \
  --latest-prompt "<the user's literal most-recent message>"
```

Resolve `--session-id`/`--channel-metadata`/`--latest-prompt` **once**, at
the start of the logical session, and reuse the same values across every
write in it — don't re-derive them per call, and don't leave them out
because the write "feels routine." An audit row with `session` blank or
`channel_metadata` absent is exactly as unauditable as a write that never
happened, even though the write itself succeeded — see this skill's own
GRC baseline.
