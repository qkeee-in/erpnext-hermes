# Non-ERPNext systems adapter procedure

Per the consolidation plan §9. This is not a connector — `scripts/core/
client.py` is Frappe-REST-specific by construction, and nothing in this
skill auto-discovers or drives an arbitrary external API. This document is
the *procedure* for the case where a user's request is about a system that
genuinely isn't ERPNext (a third-party accounting tool, a bank's own
portal, an internal tool with its own API, Tally, a payment gateway
dashboard) but still falls inside this skill's ERPNext/organizational-work
scope guardrail (`00-conventions.md`) — e.g. "reconcile this against our
Tally export" or "check the payment status in our gateway's dashboard."

## Procedure

1. **Never guess at a non-ERPNext system's shape.** Unlike ERPNext, there
   is no `discover.py meta` equivalent, no live-metadata fallback, and no
   prior domain-knowledge file to ground a guess in. Explicitly request
   one of: the system's API documentation, a user guide, or a URL to its
   docs — before attempting any action against it. If none of these is
   available, say so plainly and ask the user to describe the specific
   fields/endpoints/screens involved rather than proceeding on assumption.
2. **Treat whatever the user provides as the only ground truth for this
   system**, the same way a genuinely org-specific custom ERPNext app (no
   public repo) is handled in `02-environment-assessment.md` — build
   understanding from what's actually provided plus what the user
   explains, and say so explicitly rather than inventing a source.
3. **No credential handling beyond what's already documented for
   ERPNext.** If the non-ERPNext system needs its own API key/token, that
   follows the same discipline as `qkeee-erp.env` (see
   `01-connectivity.md`) in spirit — never typed into chat and echoed
   back, never written into agent-curated memory, never composed into a
   command that embeds the raw value. If the harness has no equivalent
   isolated-credential mechanism for a second system, say so and ask the
   user how they'd like to handle it, rather than improvising a new
   storage location.
4. **Catalog what's learned the same way as a custom Frappe app.** Once
   Phase 4's memory wiring lands, a non-ERPNext system's notes land under
   `qkeee-erp-learned/<env-tag>/references/non-erpnext/<system-slug>.md`
   — same tier, same promotion path (`memory_promote.py`'s redact +
   format, then `skill_manage`), same one-line `MEMORY.md` breadcrumb
   convention as a custom app gets under `custom-apps/<app-slug>.md`. See
   `00-conventions.md`'s naming table. Until Phase 4 lands, report
   findings back to the user plainly rather than assuming they persist.
5. **Every other non-negotiable in `00-conventions.md` still applies.**
   PII redaction, the scope guardrail, requester-attribution discipline
   where the action has a real-world approval analog, save-then-review
   before anything resembling a "write" against the external system (to
   whatever extent that system's own API supports staging) — none of that
   is ERPNext-specific, and none of it is waived just because the target
   system is.

## What this deliberately doesn't try to do

This is not a general integration-building capability. If a non-ERPNext
system becomes a repeated, trusted need, that's a signal it deserves a
proper adapter (or a dedicated domain) built deliberately — with its own
reviewed capability table, the way the eleven ERPNext domain slugs were —
not a reason to grow this ad hoc procedure's scope indefinitely.
