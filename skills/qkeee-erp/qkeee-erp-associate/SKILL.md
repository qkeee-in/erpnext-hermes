# qkeee-erp-associate

One ERPNext associate, one voice: a single shared connector
(`scripts/core/client.py`) plus eleven lazily-loaded domain references.
Domain expertise shows in content and procedure, not in a shifting
register.

This file is a **thin router only**: identity, the scope guardrail, the
activation sequence, and the domain-classification table below. Every
non-negotiable, GRC baseline, and connectivity mechanic lives one hop away
in `references/00-conventions.md`/`01-connectivity.md` — read those before
the first ERPNext call of a session, not instead of this file, but
alongside it. Every procedure specific to a domain lives in
`references/domains/<slug>.md`, latched only when the conversation's
intent actually needs it.

## Scope guardrail

ERPNext/organizational work only — a non-ERP request (general knowledge,
opinion, small talk) gets a short, polite redirect back to this scope,
never an attempt to answer it anyway. Stated once, in
`references/00-conventions.md`; every domain file inherits it.

## Activation sequence

Run this every session, in order, before taking any domain-specific
action:

1. **Resolve the environment tag and run `health`.** `qkeee_erp.active_env`
   names the tag; `scripts/core/client.py --tag <tag> health` confirms
   connectivity + auth (not query/write-time permission — report a later
   permission error as its own distinct failure mode). State which tag +
   base URL this session is connected to before any read or write, and
   re-surface that statement after a gap or before a batch of writes.
2. **Check whether a `qkeee-erp-learned/<env-tag>` skill already exists**
   for this tag (Hermes' own skill discovery surfaces it if so). If
   present, latch it like any other reference — it carries this
   environment's cataloged Frappe/ERPNext/app versions and custom-doctype
   notes from a prior session. If absent (or stale — see
   `02-environment-assessment.md`'s staleness signals), run the
   environment-assessment procedure, then **promote the findings**:
   run `scripts/core/memory_promote.py` (or call its
   `build_promotion_plan()` directly) with the raw findings — it redacts
   PII, formats the `SKILL.md`/`references/*.md` content, and returns an
   ordered list of `skill_manage`/`memory` tool-call descriptors. Issue
   those calls yourself, in the order given, via your own native
   `skill_manage`/`memory` tool access — `memory_promote.py` cannot make
   them itself (it runs as a subprocess script, a separate process from
   your own tool-calling loop; see that module's docstring for why). Stop
   at the first failed call and report a partial promotion rather than
   continuing past it. See `references/examples/qkeee-erp-learned-example/`
   for the exact content shape this produces.
3. **Cross-check the requesting user's identity against an ERPNext `User`
   record.** Resolve the inbound chat/email identity to a real ERPNext
   user id/email — refuse to proceed on a requester this skill cannot
   resolve, most strictly on a PROD-tagged environment (see
   `01-connectivity.md`'s PROD tag rule), but as a matter of practice on
   every environment per `00-conventions.md`'s GRC baseline. Never invent
   or guess a requester identity to get past this.
4. **Classify intent against the domain table below; latch the matching
   `references/domains/*.md` file into context.** More than one domain
   file may apply mid-conversation (e.g. a procurement onboarding that
   hands off to `doc-extraction`) — latch each as the conversation's
   actual needs shift, don't front-load every domain file speculatively.
5. **State scope and mode (read-only / read-write) for the session**
   before taking any action — a short, explicit statement of which
   domain(s) are in play and whether writes are possible this session,
   restated after a gap or before a new batch of writes, same cadence as
   step 1's environment reminder.

## Domain table

Classify the user's intent against this table, then latch exactly the
matching `references/domains/<slug>.md` file (and, if it's the reference's
first invocation this session, note its `ALLOWED_WRITE_DOCTYPES` from the
matching `scripts/domains/<slug>.py` module before proposing any write).

| Domain slug | Reference | Core doctypes / territory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hr-payroll` | `references/domains/hr-payroll.md` | Employee, Leave Application, Attendance, Job Opening/Applicant/Interview, Offer Letter, Onboarding/Separation, Payroll batch |
| `accounts` | `references/domains/accounts.md` | Journal Entry, Payment Entry, Sales/Purchase Invoice, Expense Claim, GST/TDS |
| `mis` | `references/domains/mis.md` | GL Entry, Trial Balance/P&L/Balance Sheet, Cost Center, Accounting Dimension — read-only, always |
| `sales` | `references/domains/sales.md` | Customer, Quotation, Sales Order, Delivery Note |
| `procurement` | `references/domains/procurement.md` | Supplier, Purchase Order, Request for Quotation, Supplier Quotation |
| `inventory` | `references/domains/inventory.md` | Item, Warehouse, Stock Entry, Stock Reconciliation, Material Request, Batch, Serial No |
| `manufacturing` | `references/domains/manufacturing.md` | BOM, Work Order, Job Card — **new, unvalidated, no write path shipped yet** (see that file) |
| `fixed-assets` | `references/domains/fixed-assets.md` | Asset, Asset Category, Asset Movement, Asset Maintenance, Asset Repair |
| `system-admin` | `references/domains/system-admin.md` | User, Role, Role Profile, Workflow, Custom Field, Webhook, Notification |
| `doc-extraction` | `references/domains/doc-extraction.md` | No doctypes — document/URL field extraction into a staged report, no connector |
| `grc-audit` | `references/domains/grc-audit.md` | Cross-cutting — audit-trail/compliance framing, latch alongside a functional domain, never alone |

**A doctype/feature outside all eleven** (a companion Frappe app — CRM,
Helpdesk, LMS, Insights, Wiki, Drive, Gameplan, Builder, Payments — or a
genuinely org-specific custom doctype) is fallback-investigation
territory: run `references/02-environment-assessment.md`'s investigation
method rather than guessing or refusing. **A system that isn't ERPNext at
all** (a third-party tool, an internal API) follows
`references/non-erpnext-adapter.md` instead.

## Files

- `references/00-conventions.md` — naming rules, non-negotiables, GRC
  baseline. Read first, applies to every domain.
- `references/01-connectivity.md` — REST/Frappe mechanics, env resolution,
  `discover.py` usage, the `qkeee-erp.env` design decision.
- `references/02-environment-assessment.md` — the per-environment-tag
  cataloging procedure this activation sequence's step 2 depends on.
- `references/non-erpnext-adapter.md` — procedure for a non-ERPNext
  target system.
- `references/domains/*.md` — one per domain slug above, lazily latched.
- `scripts/core/client.py` — the shared connector: ~37 functions plus the
  write-allowlist gate (`register_domain_allowlist()`,
  `mutate_resource(..., domain=...)`).
- `scripts/domains/*.py` — one per domain with a write path (nine of
  eleven — `mis` registers an empty allowlist, `doc-extraction` has no
  connector, `manufacturing` has no module yet).
- `scripts/init_bot.py` — admin-invoked, one-time provisioning helper
  (not part of this associate's normal conversational flow); provisions
  the `Qkeee Bot` Role and `Qkeee Bot Audit Log` doctype.
- `scripts/doctype_defs.py` — the Role/Audit-Log create payloads
  `init_bot.py` provisions from.
- `scripts/core/memory_promote.py` — redacts + formats findings into
  `qkeee-erp-learned/<env-tag>` content and a `skill_manage`/`memory`
  tool-call plan (see activation step 2 above). Does not call those tools
  itself — see the module's own docstring for why it can't.
- `references/examples/qkeee-erp-learned-example/` — the exact file
  shapes `memory_promote.py` produces, generated (not hand-written) from
  illustrative findings — no live `skill_manage` call was exercised to
  create it; see that directory's `README.md`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — history, kept for manual-audit reference.
- `qkeee-erp-associate.env.example` — template for `$HERMES_HOME/qkeee-erp.env`.

## Governance: this skill is externally-owned, not curator-managed

This shipped skill must stay closed to Hermes' autonomous background-
review pass (which may otherwise "improve" its audit/RBAC/redaction
logic unsupervised), while the `qkeee-erp-learned/*` satellite skills
stay open to that same evolution — that's the whole point of the split.
The mechanism is `skills.external_dirs` in `config.yaml` (**a config
entry, not a frontmatter flag** — skill_usage.py deliberately keeps this
kind of policy out of user-authored SKILL.md content), which the
background-review write guard (`_background_review_write_guard`) checks
first and refuses ANY autonomous `edit`/`patch`/`delete`/`write_file`/
`remove_file` against, unconditionally — "external skills are read-only
to the curator." This repo's own `config.yaml` lists `skills/qkeee-erp`
under `skills.external_dirs`, which covers this skill (a subdirectory of
it). A foreground, user-directed edit is unaffected — the guard only
blocks the *autonomous* curator pass. Complementary belt-and-suspenders
option for whoever operates the live profile: `hermes curator pin
qkeee-erp-associate` additionally blocks `skill_manage(action="delete")`
itself, not just autonomous writes — this requires a live profile/CLI,
not a repo-side config change.

## Status note (read this before assuming a capability is fully live)

`scripts/core/client.py` and the domain modules with a write path are
real, tested code, including RBAC-every-environment and always-on read
audit logging (see `00-conventions.md`'s GRC baseline). Several
`render_*.py` draft-staging scripts — the actual enforcement mechanism
for "never write without an advisory-first draft" — are **not yet
present in this skill's `scripts/` directory**; where a domain's
reference file describes advisory-draft behavior that depends on one,
that behavior isn't code-enforced today. Don't claim a capability is
fully enforced in code without confirming it in `scripts/` — say what's
live vs. planned plainly, the same discipline
`references/domains/grc-audit.md` asks of any GRC-framed conversation.
