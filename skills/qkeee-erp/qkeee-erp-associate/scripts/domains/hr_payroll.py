"""
qkeee-erp-associate — hr-payroll domain (HR, leave, payroll batch).

Offer/onboarding DRAFT composition belongs in render_employee_draft.py /
render_advisory_draft.py — those advisory-draft scripts don't exist in
this skill's scripts/ yet. The "never auto-committed" hard block on
submit/cancel itself IS code-enforced: register_domain_token_gate() below
opts this domain into core.client.mutate_resource()'s generic
confirmation-token check — see core/confirm_token.py's advisory-token CLI.

ALLOWED_WRITE_DOCTYPES covers render_employee_draft.py's target doctypes
(Employee Onboarding, Job Offer) plus Employee/Leave Application. Cross-check
against references/domains/hr-payroll.md before expanding.
