"""Allowlist-gate regression tests. Run from this directory (matches the
convention in scripts/core/test_client.py): `cd scripts/domains && python -m
pytest -q`.

core.client.mutate_resource(domain=...) refuses a write whose doctype isn't
in that domain's registered ALLOWED_WRITE_DOCTYPES, per the write-allowlist
gate (see client.py's module docstring). Each domain module below registers
its own tuple at import time via register_domain_allowlist(); these tests
confirm two things per domain: (1) a doctype NOT in the tuple is refused
with DoctypeNotAllowedError before any network call, and (2) a doctype that
IS in the tuple clears the allowlist check specifically (isolated from the
RBAC/prod-requester gate downstream, which is core.client's own concern and
already covered by scripts/core/test_client.py's WritePathGatingTests).

mis.py registers an empty allowlist — MIS is read-only, no doctype can ever
be written there. The test below is written to fail loudly (not skip) if a
doctype is ever added to mis.ALLOWED_WRITE_DOCTYPES without a matching
deliberate test update.
