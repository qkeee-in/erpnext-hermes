qkeee-erp-associate — system-admin domain (Users, roles, permissions).

Ported from qkeee-erp-system-admin/scripts/erp_client.py during Phase 1
(connector consolidation) — the skill with the widest blast radius and
heaviest GRC per the plan's section 1 table, and it shows: this domain
carries the most genuine business logic of any skill diffed in this pass
(8 functions beyond the shared core set): _record_attribution_comment(),
destructive_mutate(), get_roles_and_doctypes(), get_permissions(),
call_permission_manager(), create_user(), gated_config_mutate(), and
get_scheduler_status().

SCOPE NOTE on confirm_token.py (same call as fixed_assets.py — see that
module's docstring): permission_change_token(), destructive_action_token(),
elevated_user_token(), and config_change_token() originally lived in this
skill's own confirm_token.py, not in erp_client.py. Phase 1's task was
scoped to the ten erp_client.py copies only; rather than leave this module
non-functional pending a separate confirm_token.py consolidation pass,
those four token constructors are carried here verbatim, alongside their
consumers. Flag for Phase 2 review.

ALLOWED_WRITE_DOCTYPES is a first-pass allowlist covering the doctypes
this domain's business logic actually targets: User (create_user/
destructive_mutate), Role, Custom Field/Property Setter (customization),
Webhook/Workflow (gated_config_mutate's two CONFIG_CHANGE_KINDS). Note
that destructive_mutate()/call_permission_manager()/gated_config_mutate()
route through mutate_resource(domain="system_admin") for their underlying
write (or, for call_permission_manager, a whitelisted-method RPC outside
mutate_resource() entirely, same as fixed_assets.call_whitelisted_method())
— see each function's docstring.
