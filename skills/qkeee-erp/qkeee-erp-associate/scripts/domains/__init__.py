"""qkeee-erp-associate domain modules.

Each module here corresponds to one of the domain slugs in
00-conventions.md's fixed enum (hr-payroll, accounts, mis, sales,
procurement, inventory, manufacturing, fixed-assets, system-admin,
doc-extraction, grc-audit) and declares that domain's ALLOWED_WRITE_DOCTYPES
— see core.client.register_domain_allowlist()/mutate_resource()'s `domain`
parameter for the write-allowlist gate this feeds.

`manufacturing.py` is intentionally absent — no write path exists for that
domain yet (see references/domains/manufacturing.md). `doc_extraction.py`
is also absent — that domain has no connector at all, no doctypes to write.
