qkeee-erp-associate — sales domain (Customer, Quotation, Sales Order,
Delivery Note).

Quotation-draft composition belongs in render_quotation_draft.py — that
advisory-draft script doesn't exist in this skill's scripts/ yet. The
advisory-first submit/cancel gate itself IS code-enforced:
register_domain_token_gate() below opts this domain into
core.client.mutate_resource()'s generic confirmation-token check — see
core/confirm_token.py's advisory-token CLI.

ALLOWED_WRITE_DOCTYPES covers render_customer_draft.py/
render_quotation_draft.py's target doctypes plus Sales Order/Delivery
Note. Cross-check against references/domains/sales.md before expanding.
