"""
qkeee-erp-associate — procurement domain (Supplier, Address, Contact, PO, RFQ).

ALLOWED_WRITE_DOCTYPES covers render_po_draft.py/render_supplier_draft.py's
target doctypes plus Request for Quotation/Supplier Quotation. Cross-check
against references/domains/procurement.md before expanding.

`Address`/`Contact` were added here for F2 (.scratch/hermes-erp-bot-
reliability/spec.md): ERPNext's India-Compliance GSTIN field (and tax ID
generally) lives on Address, linked to Supplier via the standard Frappe
Dynamic Link `links` child table — never on Supplier itself. A prior
session retried GSTIN as a Supplier field, confirmed live it doesn't
persist there, and told the user it "would need a custom field on
Supplier" — wrong on both counts. See mutate()'s KYC handling below and
procurement.md's corrected write order.

    Neither given raises IncompleteSupplierKYCError before ANY write
    fires — no Supplier record, incomplete or otherwise, is created.

    completeness is an onboarding-time bar (this domain's non-negotiable
    talks about *creating* a live Supplier record), not a block on every
    later patch to an already-onboarded supplier. Backfilling KYC onto an
    existing Supplier is a plain `mutate(tag, "Address", "create", ...)`
