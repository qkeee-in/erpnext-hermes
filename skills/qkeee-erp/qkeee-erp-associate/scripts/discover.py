qkeee-erp-associate discovery helper — resolves what's actually installed on
a target ERPNext instance (apps + versions, DocType-to-module-to-app
mapping, live field schema) so this skill can reason from real metadata
instead of guessing or trusting static docs or memory of a prior instance.

## Why this file didn't exist until now

`references/01-connectivity.md`, `02-environment-assessment.md`,
`04-erp-doc-lookup.md`, and `domains/manufacturing.md` all document
`discover.py resolve|meta|modules|apps` as this skill's live-schema check
— but no `discover.py` ever shipped in this consolidated single-persona
tree. It existed once, identically, in all ten `qkeee-erp-<persona>/scripts/`
copies on the old `multi-persona-v1.0` branch (differing only in a
`--persona-code` default string) and was dropped somewhere in the
consolidation into this skill, leaving those doc references dangling.

Live-observed cost of the gap (dev-hermes, 2026-09-11, see
`.scratch/hermes-erp-bot-reliability/spec.md` finding F8): with no
`discover.py`, an agent fell back to querying `DocField` directly as a
standalone list resource (`client.py query DocField --filters
'[["parent","=","Supplier"]]'`) to find out whether Supplier has a
`gstin` field. `DocField` is a child-table doctype (`istable=1`) — Frappe
grants no role, System Manager included, standalone List permission on a
table-only doctype; it's readable only embedded inside its parent
document. That 403'd, was misread as "expected on a least-privileged
bot" (the bot in question actually held System Manager — the RBAC WARN
printed one line above said so), and the agent never fell back to the
one call that was always going to work: a single-resource GET on the
DocType record itself, which returns its `fields` child table inline.
That's exactly what `meta`/`resolve` below do.

## What changed in the resurrection, vs. the multi-persona-v1.0 copies

- **Every read now goes through `core.client.get_resource()`/
  `query_resource()`** instead of hand-rolled `_request()` calls. The old
  script called `_request()` directly for `meta`/`resolve`/`modules`,
  which entirely bypassed `_validate_prod_requester()` — this
  consolidated skill's non-negotiable 2 (`00-conventions.md`) requires
  every single read/write to carry a validated `requested_by`, no
  exceptions; the old script's own reads didn't. Routing through
  `get_resource()`/`query_resource()` fixes that for free, and also
  means every discovery read gets the same unconditional
  `Qkeee Bot Audit Log` row every other read in this skill gets.
- **The old script's own `--debug`-gated `_log()` wrapper is gone.**
  Audit logging in `core/client.py` is unconditional now — "there is no
  debug flag gating this" (`01-connectivity.md`) — so a separate opt-in
  log path for this script's own reads would have been a second,
  inconsistent logging regime. `--persona-code`/`--debug` are retired in
  favor of the `session_id`/`domain_code`/`channel`/`channel_metadata`/
  `prompt_summary`/`latest_prompt` parameters `core/client.py`'s own CLI
  already exposes, for the same reason: F8's sibling finding, F1 (audit
  rows losing channel/prompt context because a caller never threads them
  through), applies just as much to a discovery read as to a write.
- **`apps` (`frappe.utils.change_log.get_versions`) has no DocType behind
  it** — same situation `core.client.run_query_report()` is already in
  for a Report run. Kept as a direct `_request()` call, but now goes
  through `_validate_prod_requester()` and a manual `_log_read()` call
  first, mirroring `run_query_report()`'s own established pattern rather
  than the old script's ungated one.
- **`modules` uses a large explicit `limit` instead of the old
  `limit_page_length: 0` (Frappe's "no limit" sentinel).**
  `query_resource()` doesn't expose that sentinel — it always fetches
  `limit + 1` and reports `has_more`. 1000 is comfortably above any real
  org's `Module Def` count; `has_more` is still surfaced so a caller
  isn't silently handed a truncated list.

## What every caller should already know

Requires System Manager–level read access to `DocType` on the target
instance for `meta`/`resolve` — a correctly least-privileged bot account
can 403 here, and that is a real permission gap to report to the user,
not a bug in this script (see `doctype_meta()`'s docstring). `modules`/
`apps` read `Module Def`/a whitelisted RPC instead and are commonly
available even when `meta`/`resolve` aren't — try them first
(`02-environment-assessment.md` step 2 already sequences it this way).

Non-negotiable this script exists to serve: never propose a field/doctype
that isn't confirmed live on the target instance (Non-negotiable 4,
`00-conventions.md`). GitHub docs and docs.frappe.io describe the general
shape of an app; only this script's output (backed by
`/api/resource/DocType/<name>` and friends) confirms what a specific
org's instance actually has.
