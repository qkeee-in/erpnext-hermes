"""
Schema-first attribute mapping for every create/update (issue 01,
.scratch/hermes-erp-bot-reliability/issues/01-schema-first-attribute-
mapping.md — folds in F4). Generalizes F3 (Item's HSN/tax fields had no
documented home) past Item: fetches the live doctype schema
(`discover.py meta`, resurrected for F8) and matches whatever fields a
caller or an extraction step proposes against it, so a field is only
dropped because it genuinely isn't on the live doctype — never because a
domain doc's hand-curated field list forgot to mention it.

## Design decisions (see issue 01's own open questions)

- **Lives at the call-site tier (execute_write.py calls in), not inside
  mutate_resource()/gated_mutate_resource().** Doctype-field-shape
  judgment is call-site judgment, not ERP-agnostic connector logic — the
  same layering item_write_helpers.py already draws for Item's business
  defaults, and 01-connectivity.md draws for domain judgment generally.
  Embedding this in mutate_resource() would also mean every one of
  core/test_client.py's existing tests (which build payloads with
  already-correct fieldnames and mock at the HTTP layer) would need a new
  DocType-meta mock just to keep passing, for a check that changes
  nothing about a payload that was already correct. execute_write.py is
  still the single write entry point (F1) every real write goes through,
  so "runs on every create/update, unconditionally" holds in practice
  without touching the connector's own tested surface. A caller that
  mutates outside execute_write.py — e.g. procurement.py's own
  `_create_linked_kyc_record()`, which calls `core_client.mutate_resource`
  directly for the Address/Contact half of a Supplier-KYC create — does
  NOT get this check. That's a known, deliberate gap, not an oversight:
  revisit if that path turns out to need it too, rather than reaching
  into the connector to cover it now.
- **Exact/normalized match auto-applies; fuzzy/synonym matches are
  suggestions, never silently written.** A candidate key that equals a
  live fieldname, or normalizes to one (case/space/hyphen/underscore-
  insensitive), maps automatically — this is exactly today's working
  behavior for a caller that already uses correct fieldnames, just now
  confirmed against the live schema instead of assumed. Anything beyond
  that (a small hardcoded synonym table for common India-compliance
  abbreviations — HSN, GSTIN, PAN, TIN) is surfaced as a
  `suggested_mappings` entry that needs an explicit `confirmed_mappings`
  entry to ever reach a payload. Matches the issue's own risk callout:
  fuzzy matching risks mapping the wrong field, so it gets a confirmation
  step, not best-effort silence.
- **Degrade to today's behavior (payload passed through unmapped) on any
  schema-fetch failure — warn, don't refuse the write.** A correctly
  least-privileged bot (F7's own recommendation) can legitimately lack
  System-Manager-level DocType read and 403 on the schema fetch; refusing
  every write instance-wide over that would be a worse regression than an
  occasional unmapped field, matching the existing best-effort posture
  this connector already applies to audit logging and to a write that
  proceeds under an RBAC-precheck-unreliable warning. A fetch failure is
  cached per (tag, doctype) so a doctype this bot can't read metadata for
  doesn't retry the fetch on every subsequent write in the same process.
- **Cache scope: in-process, per (tag, doctype) — not cross-process or
  disk-backed.** execute_write.py is a fresh process per CLI invocation
  (one write per call), so an in-process cache only pays off for multiple
  writes to the same doctype within one process — still worth it (mirrors
  core/client.py's own `_BOT_IDENTITY_CACHE`/`_RBAC_PRECHECK_TRUST_CACHE`
  pattern) but a persistent disk cache was deliberately not built: one
  extra GET per write is the same order of cost this connector already
  pays for the RBAC pre-check and the audit pre-image fetch on every
  single write, and a disk cache would add staleness/invalidation
  questions a one-write-per-process pattern doesn't need answered yet.
- **F2/KYC interaction: complementary, not merged.** procurement.py's
  `IncompleteSupplierKYCError` gate answers a *policy* question (is KYC
  data present, or was a waiver explicitly confirmed) — this module
  answers a different, *mechanical* one (do the fields actually offered
  land on real schema fields). Both run, unchanged relative to each
  other: the KYC gate first, then — for a Supplier/Address/Contact create
  that goes through execute_write.py — this module maps whatever fields
  were supplied against that doctype's live schema, the same as any other
  create.
- **F4 handoff: schema-mapping consumes doc-extraction's staged-report
  shape directly when given one** (`match_staged_report()` below) —
  `{"field", "value", "confidence", "row"?}` per doc-extraction.md step
  6 — refusing on a field missing `confidence`/`value`
  (`MalformedStagedReportError`, finally code-enforcing that domain's own
  long-standing non-negotiable instead of only documenting it) and
  flagging — not just warning about — a field that is BOTH `low`-
  confidence AND unmatched against the live schema: the specific worst
  case issue 01 calls out, since neither signal alone would have caught
  it. `execute_write.py`'s plain `--payload` path (no staged report
  given) still runs the plain dict-keyed matcher — warn-only, never
  blocks — since there's no per-field confidence to escalate on there.
- **Known adjacent gap, not fixed here:** doc-extraction.md step 6 says
  to "render the staged report through a script" — no such script
  (`render_*.py` or otherwise) exists anywhere in this tree yet (checked:
  `find . -iname 'render_*'` is empty). `match_staged_report()` gives that
  future script something real to hand off to, but does not itself
  create the missing renderer — flagging honestly rather than silently
  assuming it exists, the same way F8's own writeup did for
  `discover.py`.

Pure functions throughout, except `get_doctype_schema()`/
`map_payload_for_write()` — the only two that talk to ERPNext (via
discover.py's already-gated `doctype_meta()`). Everything else is a plain
data transform, easy to unit-test without a live instance.
