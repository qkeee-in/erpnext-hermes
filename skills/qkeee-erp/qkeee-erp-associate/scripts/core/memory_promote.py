qkeee-erp-associate — memory promotion (Phase 4 of the consolidation plan,
see plan section 8, revised).

WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT, first — because it shapes everything below: this
is NOT a client of Hermes' `memory`/`skill_manage` tools in the sense of
importing and calling them directly. Those two tools are implemented in
`hermes-agent`'s own process (`tools/memory_tool.py`'s `memory_tool()` /
`MemoryStore`, and `tools/skill_manager_tool.py`'s `skill_manage()`) and
require in-process state this module cannot reach from where it runs:

  - `memory_tool()` needs a live `MemoryStore` instance (built via
    `load_on_disk_store()`, which itself needs `hermes_cli.config` for
    the profile's char-limit overrides) plus the write-approval gate's
    session/origin context (`tools/write_approval.py`).
  - `skill_manage()` needs the same write-approval gate context, the
    background-review provenance contextvar (`tools/skill_provenance.py`)
    that decides whether THIS call is foreground (user-directed) or
    autonomous curation, and the security scanner
    (`tools/skills_guard.py`) — none of which exist outside a live
    `hermes-agent` process.

This module's own scripts run the way every other `qkeee-erp-associate`
script does: as a subprocess under Hermes' `execute_code`/`terminal`
sandbox, a SEPARATE process from the agent's own tool-calling loop, with
no `hermes-agent` package on its path (confirmed by direct inspection of
the `hermes-agent` source for this phase — see the Phase 4 report for the
full list of what was checked). A subprocess script cannot call a tool
that only exists as a function bound into the live agent's own LLM
tool-calling loop.

So instead of "calling skill_manage", this module's actual job — matching
the plan's own framing that it "no longer owns file I/O for the durable
tier" — is: **redact, format, and hand back a plan** describing the exact
`skill_manage`/`memory` tool calls the calling agent turn should make
itself, using its own native tool access. `build_promotion_plan()` is the
single entry point; its output is a JSON-serializable list of
`{"tool": "skill_manage"|"memory", ...kwargs}` dicts, each one a
direct, ready-to-issue call in the real tool's own parameter shape
(`action`, `name`, `content`, `file_path`, `file_content`, ... for
skill_manage; `action`, `target`, `content`, `old_text` for memory) — the
agent reads this script's stdout and then makes those tool calls itself,
in the same turn, rather than this script attempting to make them.

Naming/layout matches the consolidation plan's section 10 conventions:
  qkeee-erp-learned/<env-tag>/
    SKILL.md
    references/
      environment.md
      doctypes-catalog.md
      custom-apps/<app-slug>.md      (one per custom app found)
      non-erpnext/<system-slug>.md   (one per non-ERPNext system found)

Redaction: every free-text value in the findings dict is passed through
core.client.redact_pii()/_redact_pii_deep() before it's ever formatted
into content bound for a durable, Hermes-discoverable location — per the
plan's explicit warning that skill_manage's own security scanner looks
for dangerous code patterns and prompt-injection, not sensitive-data
leakage. This pass is load-bearing, not a courtesy.

Durable, per-environment knowledge for `qkeee-erp-associate`'s `{env_tag}`
tag — created and updated via `skill_manage` by
`scripts/core/memory_promote.py`'s promotion plan, per the consolidation
plan's section 8 (self-evolving memory, tiered). This is a satellite
skill, not a copy of the associate itself: `qkeee-erp-associate` stays
protected/externally-owned (see its own SKILL.md status note); this
skill is the deliberately-open counterpart Hermes' background-review pass
may evolve over time as more is learned about this specific environment.

## What's here

- `references/environment.md` — Frappe/ERPNext/app versions, last
  assessed via the environment-assessment procedure
  (`qkeee-erp-associate/references/02-environment-assessment.md`).
- `references/doctypes-catalog.md` — custom doctypes discovered on this
  environment, with their owning app/module where known.
- `references/custom-apps/<slug>.md` — one file per companion/custom
  Frappe app investigated on this environment.
- `references/non-erpnext/<slug>.md` — one file per non-ERPNext system
  this environment's associate sessions have been told about (see
  `qkeee-erp-associate/references/non-erpnext-adapter.md`).

## Convention

Every entry below is appended under a `## Learned <YYYY-MM-DD>` heading —
never edit or delete a prior entry, per the naming conventions in
`qkeee-erp-associate/references/00-conventions.md`. All content here has
already been through `redact_pii()`/`_redact_pii_deep()` before landing —
see `memory_promote.py`'s module docstring for why that pass is
load-bearing, not a courtesy.
