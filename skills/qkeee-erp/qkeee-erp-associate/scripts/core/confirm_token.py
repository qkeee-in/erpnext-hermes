qkeee-erp-associate core — shared confirmation-token primitives, plus this
skill's advisory-first write-gate token constructor.

Several domains gate an irreversible or high-blast-radius write
(depreciation runs, asset disposal, destructive sysadmin actions, bot-user
provisioning) behind a DOUBLE confirm: the render/stage step computes a
token from the exact facts just shown to the user, and the execute step
recomputes the same token from the RPC call's own arguments, refusing to
proceed unless they match. This closes the gap where nothing ties a
render step to its execute step — without it, a caller could render a
confirmation and immediately fire the write in the same turn without the
user having actually seen the rendered facts.

This module owns the two primitives every such token needs:
  - compute_token(**fields)  — deterministic hash over arbitrary facts.
  - is_fresh(issued_at, ...) — reject stale (replayed) or implausibly-
    future tokens.

...plus this skill's OWN token constructor, `advisory_write_token()` (see
below). Unlike a domain module's own capability-reviewed writes, this
skill's `gated_mutate_resource()` (client.py) runs EVERY create/update/
submit/cancel/delete that falls outside a named domain's allowlist
through this one constructor, unconditionally — nothing outside a
domain's own ALLOWED_WRITE_DOCTYPES has had that design-time capability
review.

Other capability-specific token constructors (e.g. depreciation_run_token(),
permission_change_token(), destructive_action_token()) do NOT live here —
each domain module that needs one carries its own copy (see
domains/fixed_assets.py, domains/system_admin.py), built on top of the two
shared primitives:

    from confirm_token import compute_token, is_fresh, DEFAULT_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS

    def my_action_token(asset: str, amount: float, issued_at: int = None) -> str:
        return compute_token(
            kind="my_action",
            asset=asset,
            amount=round(float(amount), 2),
            issued_at=issued_at or int(time.time()),
        )

Every token constructor MUST include an `issued_at` timestamp field and
the execute step MUST check it with is_fresh() before honoring the token
— a token with no freshness check never expires, which defeats the
anti-replay property this whole mechanism exists for.
