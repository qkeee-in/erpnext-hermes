"""
Item payload helpers for the domain-less gated_mutate_resource() write
path (F6, F9 — .scratch/hermes-erp-bot-reliability/spec.md). `Item` has
no owning domain yet (see F3/issue 01,
.scratch/hermes-erp-bot-reliability/issues/01-schema-first-attribute-
mapping.md) — these are two narrow, live-observed data-quality bugs fixed
now at the payload-shaping step, ahead of and independent from whatever
that larger schema-first design eventually does with Item. If/when Item
gets a real domain module, that module's `mutate()` should call into
these same functions rather than re-deriving the logic — don't duplicate
it there.

Deliberately NOT wired into `core/client.py` or `execute_write.py`'s
generic dispatch as a hardcoded rule: Item-specific business judgment
belongs at the Item call site, not the ERP-agnostic connector (same
layering `01-connectivity.md` already draws for domain judgment
generally). `execute_write.py`'s `--purchase-sourced-item` flag is a
thin, optional, Item-specific conditional around these functions — see
that file.

Pure functions, no I/O, no ERPNext calls — easy to unit-test in
isolation and safe to call before any write fires.
